I take interest in machine learning & deep learning, algorithmic game theory, mathematical optimization and aspects of mathematical control theory. I like both theory and fascinating applications.

I am just about to graduate with an integrated Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens.

I grew up in a small island of the North Aegean Sea, [Lemnos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemnos).
