Policy gradient can teach you how to bluff... provably! Check my NeurIPS '25 paper with [Gabriele Farina](https://www.mit.edu/~gfarina/about/) settling the theoretical problem of convergence of REINFORCE-style algorithms in imperfect information games: [Policy Gradient Methods Converge Globally in Imperfect-Information Extensive-Form Games](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VYY5sG4EMm).
